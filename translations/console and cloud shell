Essential Google Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation

LAB: Console and Cloud Shell 

Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

    Get access to Google Cloud.

    Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

    Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

    Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

1.Create a Cloud Storage bucket using the Cloud Console.

	gsutil mb gs://orina-bucket

2. Create a Cloud Storage bucket using Cloud Shell.

	gsutil mb gs://bkt2
    To list buckets created:

	gsutil ls

	Results:
	gs://orina-bucket/
	gs://bkt2/

3.  Become familiar with Cloud Shell features.

    Click the three dots icon in the Cloud Shell toolbar to display further options.

    Click Upload file. Upload any file from your local machine to the Cloud Shell VM. 
    This file   will be referred to as [MY_FILE].

    In Cloud Shell, type ls to confirm that the file was uploaded.

    Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab. Replace 
    [MY_FILE] with the file you uploaded and [BUCKET_NAME] with one of your bucket names:

	gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

    If your filename has whitespaces, ensure to place single quotes around the filename. 
    For example, gsutil cp â€˜my file.txt' gs://[BUCKET_NAME]

    You have uploaded a file to the Cloud Shell VM and copied it to a bucket.

    Close all the Cloud Shell sessions.

4.  Create a persistent state in Cloud Shell

    To list available regions, execute the following command:

	gcloud compute regions list

    Select a region from the list and note the value in any text editor. This region will 
    now be referred to as [YOUR_REGION] in the remainder of the lab.

    -Create and verify an environment variable

     Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected 
     in the previous step:

	INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]

    Verify it with echo:

	echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

    close cloud shell

	exit

    -Append the environment variable to a file

    Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:

	mkdir infraclass

    Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:

	touch infraclass/config

    Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:

	echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

    Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] 
    with your Project ID. You can find the project ID on the Cloud Console Home page.

	INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

    Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:

	echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

    Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command
    to verify that the project variable was set

	source infraclass/config
	echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

    Close Cloud Shell.

	exit

    Re open cloud shell. Then issue the echo command again:

	echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
    Results: There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists.

    -Modify the bash profile and create persistence

    Edit the shell profile with the following command:

	nano .profile

    Add the following line to the end of the file:

	source infraclass/config

    Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

    Close cloud shell
	exit

    Then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.

    Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:

	echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
	Result: You should now see the expected value that you set in the config file.

5. Review the Google Cloud interface


    Cloud Shell is an excellent interactive environment for exploring Google Cloud 
    using Google Cloud SDK commands like gcloud and gsutil
